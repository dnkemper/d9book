## Import content from another Migration into Paragraphs

This migration Process snippet example demonstrates how to populate the fields of a Drupal Paragraph. Whereas standard fields can be simply mapped 1:1, and its value attribute (`value`) is implied (derived), a Paragraph requires _both_ a `target_id` and `target_revision_id`. Annotations included inline to demonstrate what is going on within.

```yaml
  # Field name is `field_paragraph_authors`, specific property `target_id`:
  field_paragraph_authors/target_id:
  - plugin: migration_lookup
    # Dependent Migration called `migration_paragraph_linked_author`
    migration: migration_paragraph_linked_author
    # Don't create stub content if the row currently being processes does not map to an item in the earlier-run Migration
    no_stub: true
    # How to map this Migration with the earlier-run Migration
    source: sku
  - plugin: skip_on_empty
    # Method: If empty, skip only this field mapping (`process`), not the entire Row (`row`)
    method: process
  - plugin: extract
    # This destination property is 1st element in the migration-lookup array.
    index:
      - 0
  # Other half of `field_paragraph_authors`, specific property `target_revision_id`:
  field_paragraph_authors/target_revision_id:
  - plugin: migration_lookup
    migration: migration_paragraph_linked_author
    no_stub: true
    source: sku
  - plugin: skip_on_empty
    method: process
  - plugin: extract
    # This destination property is the 2nd element in the migration-lookup array.
    index:
      - 1
```
