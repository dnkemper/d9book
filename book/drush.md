## Overview

Drush is the command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush core ships with lots of [useful commands](https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/all/) and [generators](https://www.drush.org/latest/generators/all/).

Drush can run `update.php`, cron, executes SQL queries, run content migrations, and more.

Drush can be extended by [3rd party commandfiles](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module?f%5B0%5D=&f%5B1%5D=&f%5B2%5D=&f%5B3%5D=&f%5B4%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull&f%5B5%5D=&f%5B6%5D=&text=drush&solrsort=score+desc&op=Search).

Drush is extensible with the ability to create drush commands and drush scripts.

More [at drush.org](https://www.drush.org/latest/)


## Custom Drush commands

These are new commands that you can add to your modules to allow drush to do useful things. Modules sometimes include drush commands e.g. [search api](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api).

Drush commands need a single file in `module/src/Drush/Commands` which has the class (extending `DrushCommands`) and the annotated function which executes the command.



### Generate commands

Drush can generate all the files to create a new command. Use:

```bash
$ drush generate drush:command-file
```
Or `drush gen dcf`

This is what the most recent version of drush generates.  In this case I did ask it to inject the `entity_type.manager` service. The file is `web/modules/custom/drush_play2/src/Drush/Commands/DrushPlay2Commands.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace Drupal\drush_play2\Drush\Commands;

use Consolidation\OutputFormatters\StructuredData\RowsOfFields;
use Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityTypeManagerInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Utility\Token;
use Drush\Attributes as CLI;
use Drush\Commands\DrushCommands;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface;

/**
 * A Drush commandfile.
 */
final class DrushPlay2Commands extends DrushCommands {

  /**
   * Constructs a DrushPlay2Commands object.
   */
  public function __construct(
    private readonly Token $token,
    private readonly EntityTypeManagerInterface $entityTypeManager,
  ) {
    parent::__construct();
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function create(ContainerInterface $container) {
    return new static(
      $container->get('token'),
      $container->get('entity_type.manager'),
    );
  }

  /**
   * Command description here.
   */
  #[CLI\Command(name: 'drush_play2:command-name', aliases: ['foo'])]
  #[CLI\Argument(name: 'arg1', description: 'Argument description.')]
  #[CLI\Option(name: 'option-name', description: 'Option description')]
  #[CLI\Usage(name: 'drush_play2:command-name foo', description: 'Usage description')]
  public function commandName($arg1, $options = ['option-name' => 'default']) {
    $this->logger()->success(dt('Achievement unlocked.'));
  }

  /**
   * An example of the table output format.
   */
  #[CLI\Command(name: 'drush_play2:token', aliases: ['token'])]
  #[CLI\FieldLabels(labels: [
    'group' => 'Group',
    'token' => 'Token',
    'name' => 'Name'
  ])]
  #[CLI\DefaultTableFields(fields: ['group', 'token', 'name'])]
  #[CLI\FilterDefaultField(field: 'name')]
  public function token($options = ['format' => 'table']): RowsOfFields {
    $all = $this->token->getInfo();
    foreach ($all['tokens'] as $group => $tokens) {
      foreach ($tokens as $key => $token) {
        $rows[] = [
          'group' => $group,
          'token' => $key,
          'name' => $token['name'],
        ];
      }
    }
    return new RowsOfFields($rows);
  }

}
```

You can execute the commands defined here with `drush drush_play2:command-name abc` or `drush foo abc` which will output "Achievement unlocked" or `drush drush_play2:token` or `drush token` which will output a long table.



### Drush command that finds all uses of the button paragraph type

Here is a command that finds all uses of the button paragraph type.  It is in the `web/modules/custom/drush_play/src/Drush/Commands/DrushPlayCommands.php` file:

```php
<?php

namespace Drupal\drush_play\Drush\Commands;

use Consolidation\OutputFormatters\StructuredData\RowsOfFields;
use Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityFieldManagerInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityTypeManagerInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Entity\Query\Sql\QueryFactory;
use Drupal\Core\Logger\LoggerChannelInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Utility\Token;
use Drush\Attributes as CLI;
use Drush\Commands\DrushCommands;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface;

/**
 * A Drush commandfile.
 */
final class DrushPlayCommands extends DrushCommands {

  private EntityFieldManagerInterface $entityFieldManager;

  /**
   * Constructs a DrushPlayCommands object.
   */
  public function __construct(
    private readonly Token $token,
    private readonly EntityTypeManagerInterface $entityTypeManager,
    private readonly QueryFactory $entityQuerySql,
    private readonly LoggerChannelInterface $loggerChannelDefault,
    EntityFieldManagerInterface $entityFieldManager
  ) {
    parent::__construct();
    $this->entityFieldManager = $entityFieldManager;

  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function create(ContainerInterface $container) {
    return new static(
      $container->get('token'),
      $container->get('entity_type.manager'),
      $container->get('entity.query.sql'),
      $container->get('logger.channel.default'),
      $container->get('entity_field.manager')
    );
  }


  /**
   * Find content types that use the "button" paragraph type.
   */
  #[CLI\Command(name: 'drush_play:find-button-usage', aliases: ['fbu'])]
  #[CLI\Description(description: 'Finds content types that use the "button" paragraph type.')]
  public function findButtonUsage(): RowsOfFields {
    $contentTypes = $this->entityTypeManager->getStorage('node_type')->loadMultiple();
    $rows = [];

      foreach ($contentTypes as $contentType) {
        // Use the entityFieldManager to get field definitions
      $fields = $this->entityFieldManager->getFieldDefinitions('node', $contentType->id());
      foreach ($fields as $field) {
        if ($field->getType() === 'entity_reference_revisions') {
          $settings = $field->getSettings();
          if (isset($settings['target_type']) && $settings['target_type'] === 'paragraph') {
            $allowedTypes = $settings['handler_settings']['target_bundles'] ?? [];
            if (in_array('button', $allowedTypes)) {
              $rows[] = [
                'content_type' => $contentType->id(),
                'field_name' => $field->getName(),
              ];
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    if (empty($rows)) {
      $this->logger()->warning(dt('No content types found using the "button" paragraph type.'));
      return new RowsOfFields([]);
    }

    return new RowsOfFields($rows);
  }

}
```

The command `drush drush_play:find-button-usage` will output a list of content types that use the button paragraph type. e.g.

```
$ drush fbu
  content_type: button_tester
  field_name: field_buttons
```

For a little more flexibility, this function can be added to the above file to list the content types, as well as the most recent 5 nodes of each type that use the paragraph type.  This is in the `web/modules/custom/drush_play/src/Drush/Commands/DrushPlayCommands.php` file:


```php
  /**
   * Lists content types using a specified paragraph and URLs to the most recent 5 nodes of each type.
   */
  #[CLI\Command(name: 'drush_play:list-usage', aliases: ['lpu'])]
  #[CLI\Description(description: 'Lists content types using a specified paragraph and URLs to the most recent 5 nodes of each type.')]
  #[CLI\Argument(name: 'paragraph_machine_name', description: 'The machine name of the paragraph type.')]
  public function listUsage($paragraph_machine_name): RowsOfFields {
    $contentTypes = $this->entityTypeManager->getStorage('node_type')->loadMultiple();
    $rows = [];
    $nodeUrls = [];

    foreach ($contentTypes as $contentType) {
      $fields = $this->entityFieldManager->getFieldDefinitions('node', $contentType->id());
      foreach ($fields as $field) {
        if ($field->getType() === 'entity_reference_revisions') {
          $settings = $field->getSettings();
          if (isset($settings['target_type']) && $settings['target_type'] === 'paragraph') {
            $allowedTypes = $settings['handler_settings']['target_bundles'] ?? [];
            if (in_array($paragraph_machine_name, $allowedTypes)) {
              $rows[] = [
                'content_type' => $contentType->id(),
                'field_name' => $field->getName(),
              ];

              // Query for the most recent 5 nodes of this content type using the paragraph
              $content_types = [];
              foreach ($rows as $row) {
                if (!in_array($row['content_type'], $content_types)) {
                  $content_types[] = $row['content_type'];
                }
              }

              $nodeStorage = $this->entityTypeManager->getStorage('node');
              $query = $nodeStorage->getQuery()
                ->condition('type', $content_types, 'IN')
                //->condition($field->getName() . '.target_id', $paragraph_machine_name, '=')
                ->range(0, 5)
                ->accessCheck(FALSE)
                ->sort('created', 'DESC');
              $nids = $query->execute();

              foreach ($nids as $nid) {
                $nodeUrls[$contentType->id()][] = \Drupal::request()->getSchemeAndHttpHost() . '/node/' . $nid;
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    if (empty($rows)) {
      $this->logger()->warning(dt('No content types found using the specified paragraph type.'));
      return new RowsOfFields([]);
    }

    // Output the content types and URLs
    foreach ($rows as &$row) {
      $contentType = $row['content_type'];
      $row['recent_nodes'] = implode(', ', $nodeUrls[$contentType] ?? []);
    }

    return new RowsOfFields($rows);
  }
```

The command's output looks like this when searching for a paragraph type named "button":

```
$ drush lpu button

  content_type: button_tester
  field_name: field_buttons
  recent_nodes: 'http://default/node/121, http://default/node/120'
```


### Drush command Example

The (Search API module)[https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api] has a set of Drush commands.

There is a `web/modules/contrib/search_api/drush.services.yml`

```yml
services:
  search_api.commands:
    class: Drupal\search_api\Commands\SearchApiCommands
    arguments: ['@entity_type.manager', '@module_handler', '@event_dispatcher']
    tags:
      - { name: drush.command }
```

Here is the beginning of the `web/modules/contrib/search_api/src/Commands/SearchApiCommands.php` which includes the class `SearchApiCommands` which extends the `DrushCommands` class:

```php
<?php

namespace Drupal\search_api\Commands;

use Consolidation\OutputFormatters\StructuredData\RowsOfFields;
use Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityTypeManagerInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Extension\ModuleHandlerInterface;
use Drupal\search_api\Contrib\RowsOfMultiValueFields;
use Drupal\search_api\Utility\CommandHelper;
use Drush\Commands\DrushCommands;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
use Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface;

/**
 * Defines Drush commands for the Search API.
 */
class SearchApiCommands extends DrushCommands {

  /**
   * The command helper.
   *
   * @var \Drupal\search_api\Utility\CommandHelper
   */
  protected $commandHelper;

  /**
   * Constructs a SearchApiCommands object.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityTypeManagerInterface $entityTypeManager
   *   The entity type manager.
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Extension\ModuleHandlerInterface $moduleHandler
   *   The module handler.
   * @param \Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher
   *   The event dispatcher.
   *
   * @throws \Drupal\Component\Plugin\Exception\InvalidPluginDefinitionException
   *   Thrown if the "search_api_index" or "search_api_server" entity types'
   *   storage handlers couldn't be loaded.
   * @throws \Drupal\Component\Plugin\Exception\PluginNotFoundException
   *   Thrown if the "search_api_index" or "search_api_server" entity types are
   *   unknown.
   */
  public function __construct(EntityTypeManagerInterface $entityTypeManager, ModuleHandlerInterface $moduleHandler, EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher) {
    parent::__construct();

    $this->commandHelper = new CommandHelper($entityTypeManager, $moduleHandler, $eventDispatcher, 'dt');
  }
```

Here is an example command (`search_api:enable`) from Search_API. This is an excerpt from `web/modules/contrib/search_api/src/Commands/SearchApiCommands.php`. Looking at the annotation you can see all the details of the command as well as the aliases. This annotation provides the ability to issue the command `drush search_api:enable`. The aliases allow you to use `drush sapi-en` or `drush search-api-enable` as well. Note. You can always add aliases etc. like `drush @apc.dev sapi-en`.

```php
/**
 * Enables one disabled search index.
 *
 * @param string $indexId
 *   A search index ID.
 *
 * @throws \Drupal\search_api\ConsoleException
 *   Thrown if no indexes could be loaded.
 *
 * @command search-api:enable
 *
 * @usage drush search-api:enable node_index
 *   Enable the search index with the ID node_index.
 *
 * @aliases sapi-en,search-api-enable
 */
public function enable($indexId) {
  $this->commandHelper->enableIndexCommand([$indexId]);
}
```
You also need a `composer.json` in the custom module directory. Note the `extra, drush, services` that reference the `drush.services.yml` file:


Here is the version that drush generates by default:

```yml
{
    "name": "org/tea_vote_cache",
    "type": "drupal-drush",
    "extra": {
        "drush": {
            "services": {
                "drush.services.yml": "^10"
            }
        }
    }
}
```


Here is the composer.json from a project where I used (Search API module)[https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api] module at web/modules/contrib/search_api/composer.json:

```yml
{
  "name": "drupal/search_api",

      }

  "conflict": {
    "drupal/search_api_solr": "2.* || 3.0 || 3.1"

}
```

For another example, check out [Custom Drush commands with Drush Generate by Marc Berger of Four Kitchens - Mar 2024](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/development/custom-drush-commands-drush-generate/)


### Drush commands and parameters

You can specify the commands with a member function and all its parameters like this:


Here we have a command 
```php
public function commandWarmVotingCache($scope = 'current', $program_nid = 0, $options = ['option-name' => 'default']): int {
```
This expects a command like: `drush cwarm current 12345`

::: tip Note
The $options parameter is not generally for you to use.  Drush uses it for all sorts of parameters internally.  It is interesting to look at the values in the debugger.
:::

### Output messages on screen
Here we use `print`:

```php
  $program_title = $program_node->getTitle();
  print "Warming cache for program_nid: $program_nid Title: $program_title\n";
  $progress = new Progress($program_nid);
  $max_vote_number = $program_node->get('field_srp_vote_number')->value;
  for ($vote_number = 0; $vote_number <= $max_vote_number; $vote_number++) {
    $status = $progress->getTeamKssCompletionStatus($vote_number);
    print "vote_number: $vote_number, Team KSS completion status: $status\n";
  }
```

You can use the Drupal logger to output data to the terminal.  If you specify `->info` instead of `->notice` below you will only see the output in the terminal if you add -vvv to the drush command i.e. `drush cwarm current -vvv`
```php
\Drupal::logger('tea_teks_voting')->notice("Drush cache warm requested. Scope: $scope, Program_nid = $program_nid");
```

```php
  if ($rc === 0 ) {
    $this->logger()->success(dt('Operation completed.'));
  }
  else {
    $this->logger()->error(dt('Failed to complete processing.'));
  }
```


## Drush Scripts

These are PHP Scripts that run after a full Drupal bootstrap. From <https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/php_script/#options> : A useful
alternative to eval command when your php is lengthy or you can\'t be bothered to figure out bash quoting. If you plan to share a script with others, consider making a full Drush command instead, since that\'s more self-documenting. Drush provides command line options to the script via a variable called `$extra`.

You can execute these scripts with `drush scr script` (where script is the filename of the script to execute.). If you put the script in the
`docroot` (or `web`) directory, you don\'t need to specify a path.

**TL;DR**

1.  Put script file in docroot (No need to make it executable.)

2.  Requires opening `<?php` tag

3.  Execute with `drush scr scriptname arg1 arg2`

4.  Arguments show up in the `$extra array` i.e. `$extra[0]...`

5.  Print with `$this->output()->writeln`, `print "\n"` or `echo "\n"`

### Run your scripts

e.g. to execute example.drush

```bash
$ ddev drush php:script example.drush
```
I prefer the alias

```bash
$ddev drush scr example.drush
```
If you want to ssh into the DDEV container, you can use:

```bash
$ ddev ssh

$ drush scr example.drush
```
If you have drush installed globally, you can also run it from the host with:

```bash
$ drush scr example.drush
```


### Arguments example

Here is a simple example `example2.drush` showing arguments:

```php
<?php

use Drush\Drush;

$this->output()->writeln("Hello world!");
// $extra is an array if you issue arguments e.g.
// drush scr example2.drush abc def
$this->output()->writeln("The extra options/arguments to this command were:");
$this->output()->writeln(print_r($extra, true));
```

Here is the script being run via ddev and showing its output:

```bash
$ ddev drush scr example2.drush abc def
Hello world!
The extra options/arguments to this command were:
Array
(
    [0] => abc
    [1] => def
)
```

### Arguments example2

Here is `opinion_renamer.php` script that expects a parameter and dies if it doesn't find it. Also if the second parameter is R, it reports that it is reverting titles.

```php
<?php

print ("usage: drush scr test1 <acg term id> <R>\n");
print ("e.g. 976 is the termid for John Smith.\n");


$acg = $extra[0] ?? '';
if (empty($acg)) {
  die("no acg termid");
}
$undo = FALSE;
if (isset($extra[1])) {
  $revert = $extra[1];
  if (strtoupper($revert) == "R") {
    $undo = TRUE;
    print("reverting titles for acg $acg\n");
  }
}
```


### Hello world example

Here is an [example of a script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/11.x/examples/helloworld.script):

```php
<?php

//
// This example demonstrates how to write a drush
// script. These scripts are run with the php:script command.
//
use Drush\Drush;

$this->output()->writeln("Hello world!");
$this->output()->writeln("The extra options/arguments to this command were:");
$this->output()->writeln(print_r($extra, true));

//
// We can check which site was bootstrapped via
// the '@self' alias, which is defined only if
// there is a bootstrapped site.
//
$self = Drush::aliasManager()->getSelf();;
if (!$self->hasRoot()) {
  $this->output()->writeln('No bootstrapped site.');
}
else {
  $this->output()->writeln('The following site is bootstrapped:');
  $this->output()->writeln(print_r($self->legacyRecord(), true));
}
```
Executing it looks like this:

```
$ ddev drush scr example.drush
Hello world!
The extra options/arguments to this command were:
Array
(
)

The following site is bootstrapped:
Array
(
    [root] => /var/www/html/web
    [uri] => https://d9book2.ddev.site
)
```


### Database query example

Here is `example3.drush` with a database query:

```php
<?php

use Drush\Drush;

$database = \Drupal::database();
$query = $database->query("SELECT nid, vid, type  FROM {node} n");
$results = $query->fetchAll();

$result_count = count($results);
$this->output()->writeln("Result count = " . $result_count);
```


### entityQuery example

Here is `equery1.php` showing looping through results of the query

```php
<?php

$query = \Drupal::entityQuery('node');
$query->condition('status', 1);
$query->condition('type', 'vote');
$query->sort('title', 'ASC');
$nids = $query->execute();

if (empty($nids)) {
  $this->output()->writeln("No votes found");
}
else {
  $this->output()->writeln("Found " . count($nids) . " articles");
}

foreach ($nids as $nid) {
  $node = \Drupal\node\Entity\Node::load($nid);
  $title = $node->getTitle();
  $this->output()->writeln("Nid: " . $nid . " title: " . $title);
}
```

You could also change values and update the nodes using code like this:

```php
foreach ($nids as $nid) {
  $node = \Drupal\node\Entity\Node::load($nid);
  $title = $node->getTitle();

  $old_title = substr($title, 0, 7);
  print("$title to $old_title\n");
  $node->set('title', $old_title);
  $node->save();
}
print "finished.\n";
return;
```

## Maintenance mode

To check if the site is in maintenance mode, use this command.  It will return 1 indicating the site is IN maintenance mode, 0 indicating it is *NOT* in maintenance mode:

```sh
drush state:get system.maintenance_mode
```

Set the site into maintenance mode:
```sh
drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 1
```


Take the site out of maintenance mode:
```sh
drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 0
```

Also
```sh
drush config:set system.maintenance message "Optional message" -y
drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 1 --input-format=integer
drush cache:rebuild
```

and you can use the abbreviated form of the drush command: `drush sset` or `drush sget`.

## Drush does that?

Who isn\'t impressed by the things Drush does? It really shows off the incredible talent of Moshe Weitzman and the team that keep Drush moving. Drush can do **so many things**. Here are a few that I like:


### List blocks

To get `drush` to list all the blocks on your site.

```bash
drush ev "print_r(array_keys(\Drupal::service('plugin.manager.block')->getDefinitions()));"
```

which outputs something like:

![Block listing](/images/block_listing.png)

### List content types and fields

To get `drush` to list all the content types on your site:

```bash
drush ev "print_r(array_keys(\Drupal\node\Entity\NodeType::loadMultiple()));"
Array
(
    [0] => ad_block
    [1] => announcement
    [2] => committee
    [3] => committee_member
    [4] => document
)
```

To list all the fields on a content type use `drush fi` (or `drush field:info`).  If you just run `drush field_info` with no arguments, you will be prompted for the entity type and bundle.  If you know the entity type and bundle you can specify them as arguments.  Here is an example for the `page` content type:

```bash

$ drush field:info node page
 ------------------------ ---------- ----------------------------- -------------
  Field name               Required   Field type                    Cardinality
 ------------------------ ---------- ----------------------------- -------------
  field_access_role                   entity_access_by_role_field   -1
  field_committee                     entity_reference              1
  field_main_content                  text_long                     1
  field_primary_image                 entity_reference              1
  field_standard                      entity_reference              1
  layout_builder__layout              layout_section                -1
 ------------------------ ---------- ----------------------------- -------------

```

### List roles

To get `drush` to list all the roles on your site: `drush role:list --format=list`

```bash
anonymous
authenticated
abc_employee
abc_member
administrator
```

If you want the roles with their permissions, you can use `drush role:permissions`:

```bash
$ drush role:list
anonymous:
  rid: anonymous
  label: 'Anonymous User'
  perms:
    - 'access content'
    - 'view media'
authenticated:
  rid: authenticated
  label: 'Authenticated User'
  perms:
    - 'access content'
    - 'delete own files'
    - 'edit own image media'
    - 'use text format webform_default'
    - 'view media'
abc_employee:
  rid: abc_employee
  label: 'ABC Employee'
  perms:
    - 'access administration pages'
    - 'access content overview'
    - 'access contextual links'
    ...
```

### Generate code

Drush can scaffold (write your beginning code) modules, controllers, blocks, and much more (maybe not quite as well as ChatGPT 😉), which will save you tons of time. Use commands like `drush generate module`, `drush generate controller` or `drush generate plugin:block` to get a nice starting point for you to write your own controllers. 

Check out 
- [Drush Generators](https://www.drush.org/12.x/generators/all/)
- [Generating controllers](https://www.drush.org/latest/generators/controller/)
- [Generating block plugins](https://www.drush.org/12.x/generators/plugin_block/)


This is what it looks like to generate a controller:


```
$ drush generate controller

 Welcome to controller generator!
----------------------------------

 Module machine name [web]:
 ➤ general

 Class [GeneralController]:
 ➤ ExampleController

 Would you like to inject dependencies? [No]:
 ➤

 Would you like to create a route for this controller? [Yes]:
 ➤

 Route name [general.example]:
 ➤ general.book_example

 Route path [/general/example]:
 ➤ /general/book_example

 Route title [Example]:
 ➤ Book Example

 Route permission [access content]:
 ➤

 The following directories and files have been created or updated:

 • /Users/selwyn/Sites/d9book2/web/modules/custom/general/src/Controller/ExampleController.php
```

### Retrieve database with sql-dump

I often use `drush @site.prod sql-dump > prod.sql` to get a copy of the production database.  This is a quick way to get a copy of the database to work with locally.  For import into the DDEV database, it needs to be gzipped with `gzip prod.sql` and then can be imported with `ddev import-db --file=prod.sql.gz`.

On Acquia, when you drush use sql-dump, you might see the following error:
```
drush @abc.prod sql-dump >dbprod.sql

In Process.php line 1022:

  TTY mode requires /dev/tty to be read/writable.
```

To fix this modify the drush alias file by adding the following key under each environment's alias:

```yml
  ssh:
    tty: 0
```

Here is an example of an alias file:

```yml
prod:
  root: /var/www/html/docroot
  ac-site: abc
  ac-env: prod
  ac-realm: prod
  uri: abc.prod.acquia-sites.com
  host: abc.ssh.prod.acquia-sites.com
  user: abc.prod
  paths:
    drush-script: /var/www/html/vendor/bin/drush
  ssh:
    tty: 0

test:
  root: /var/www/html/docroot
  ac-site: abc
  ac-env: test
  ac-realm: test
  uri: abc.prod.acquia-sites.com
  host: abctest.ssh.prod.acquia-sites.com
  user: abc.test
  paths:
    drush-script: /var/www/html/vendor/bin/drush
  ssh:
    tty: 0

dev:
  root: /var/www/html/docroot
  ac-site: abc
  ac-env: dev
  ac-realm: dev
  uri: abcdev.prod.acquia-sites.com
  host: abcdev.ssh.prod.acquia-sites.com
  user: abc.dev
  paths:
    drush-script: /var/www/html/vendor/bin/drush
  ssh:
    tty: 0
```


### Sanitize Databases

From <https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/sql_sanitize/>

Sanitize the database by removing or obfuscating user data.

Commandfiles may add custom operations by implementing:

-   `@hook on-event sql-sanitize-confirms`. Display summary to user before confirmation.

-   `@hook post-command sql-sanitize`. Run queries or call APIs to perform sanitizing

Several working commandfiles may be found at <https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/tree/11.x/src/Drupal/Commands/sql>


### Delete nodes

To delete all node entities in batches of 5 use:
```
drush entity:delete node --chunks=5
```

More from <https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/entity_delete/>

-   `drush entity:delete node --bundle=article`. Delete all article entities.

-   `drush entity:delete shortcut`. Delete all shortcut entities.

-   `drush entity:delete node 22,24`. Delete nodes 22 and 24.

-   `drush entity:delete node --exclude=9,14,81`. Delete all nodes except node 9, 14 and 81.

-   `drush entity:delete user`. Delete all users except uid=1.

-   `drush entity:delete node --chunks=5`. Delete all node entities in steps of 5.

### Delete redirects

Delete all redirects on local site

```
drush @self entity:delete redirect
```
### Watch the watchdog log

```
$ drush watchdog:tail

348	09/Jan 19:29	cron	Info	Cron run completed.

### Read Drupal config

To display any config value, use drush cget:

```
$ drush cget admin_toolbar.settings

menu_depth: 4
```
Or

```
$ drush cget user.settings
_core:
  default_config_hash: w314Zp7B4zzzzzzzzzv-KwZO2E1fSSK0

cancel_method: user_cancel_block
password_reset_timeout: 86400
password_strength: true
```

More on [reading Drupal configuration with Drush](config#read-config-values-with-drush) 

And yes, you can use config:set (or cset) to change configuration. For more see <https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/config_get/>




### Check if current config matches exported config

When working on a project, to make sure you have exported any changes to config so you can check it into git, use drush cst and drush cex to
export.

```
$ drush cst
 [notice] No differences between DB and sync directory.
```

```
$ drush cex -y
```
More at <https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/config_status/> and <https://www.drush.org/latest/commands/config_export/>

Importing the config (and overwriting what is currently in the database is accomplished with:

```
$ drush cim -y
```

### User Login

```
$ drush uli 1 /admin/config (uid = 1, go directly to /admin/config)

$ drush uli --name=Sarah

$ drush uli --mail=Phase3TestPark@mightycitizen.com

$ drush @wolfman.local uli --no-browser

$ drush uli --no-browser

### Open a CLI with Drupal bootstrapped

Use `drush php:cli` to open a PHP CLI with Drupal bootstrapped. This is useful for debugging or running PHP code in the context of your Drupal site.

```bash
Psy Shell v0.12.3 (PHP 8.1.25 — cli) by Justin Hileman
Ddev 102 site (Drupal 10.2.5)

> $x = Node::load(1);
= Drupal\node\Entity\Node {#6835
    +in_preview: null,
    translationLanguages: "en",
    nid (integer): "1",
    uuid (uuid): "0bcddef8-4c2e-4e3e-96a5-ec68d92d4506",
    vid (integer): "6",
    langcode (language): "en",
    type (entity_reference): "article",
    revision_timestamp (created): "1712933329",
    revision_uid (entity_reference): "User::load(1)",
    revision_log (string_long): [],
    status (boolean): "1",
    uid (entity_reference): "User::load(1)",
    title (string): "test article",
    created (created): "1712077117",
...


> $x
= Drupal\node\Entity\Node {#6835
    +in_preview: null,
    translationLanguages: "en",
    nid (integer): "1",
    uuid (uuid): "0bcddef8-4c2e-4e3e-96a5-ec68d92d4506",
    vid (integer): "6",
    langcode (language): "en",
    type (entity_reference): "article",
    revision_timestamp (created): "1712933329",
    revision_uid (entity_reference): "User::load(1)",
    revision_log (string_long): [],
    status (boolean): "1",
    uid (entity_reference): "User::load(1)",
    title (string): "test article",
    created (created): "1712077117",
...

> $x->getTitle();
test article

> $x->set('title','new article title')->save();
= 2

> $x->getTitle();
= "new article title"
```

Asking drush to give you a render array for the node $x is a good way to see what is available to you in the node object.  Here is how you can do that:

```bash
> $x = Node::load(1);
= Drupal\node\Entity\Node {#6835
    +in_preview: null,
    translationLanguages: "en",
    nid (integer): "1",
    uuid (uuid): "0bcddef8-4c2e-4e3e-96a5-ec68d92d4506",
    vid (integer): "6",
    langcode (language): "en",
    type (entity_reference): "article",
    revision_timestamp (created): "1712933329",
    revision_uid (entity_reference): "User::load(1)",
    revision_log (string_long): [],
    status (boolean): "1",
    uid (entity_reference): "User::load(1)",
    title (string): "test article",
    created (created): "1712077117",
...


> $view_builder = \Drupal::entityTypeManager()->getViewBuilder('node');
= Drupal\node\NodeViewBuilder {#6404}

> $output = $view_builder->view($x);
= [
    "#node" => Drupal\node\Entity\Node {#6835
      +in_preview: null,
    },
    "#view_mode" => "full",
    "#cache" => [
      "tags" => [
        "node_view",
        "node:1",
      ],
      "contexts" => [
        "route.name.is_layout_builder_ui",
      ],
      "max-age" => -1,
      "keys" => [
        "entity_view",
        "node",
        "1",
        "full",
      ],
      "bin" => "render",
    ],
    "#theme" => "node",
    "#weight" => 0,
    "#pre_render" => [
      [
        Drupal\node\NodeViewBuilder {#6404},
        "build",
      ],
    ],
  ]
```

## Global Drush - run drush on host

I find that installing drush version 8 globally is most convenient for my Drupal development as I frequently run drush commands in the terminal and really like the command completion afforded by [Oh-my-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).  Drush runs slightly slower than the equivalent `ddev drush` commands when installed this way. The host drush version doesn't matter very much since it is only used to find the proper drush version (most likely within `/vendor/bin`) and call it. **Always** install drush in each project using composer.

::: warning
You should be aware that you might get unpredictable results if you use differing versions of PHP on your local vs in the DDEV containers.  E.g. if your local mac has PHP 7 and your DDEV is using PHP 8.1, you are likely to have unpredictable results when you issue some drush commands.  Generally speaking I haven't seen things be too wacky, but you should be aware of this.
:::

Use Composer to install drush. Don't use homebrew.

```sh
composer global require drush/drush ^8
```
Then add Drush to your system path by placing the following in your ~/.zshrc (or if using bash: `~/.bash_profile`):

```
 export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH" 
``` 

::: tip Note
Test any of these path changes by running `source ~/.zshrc` to reload the environment variables.  You can also open a new iterm window if you prefer.
:::

By setting up drush globally, you can navigate into a Drupal directory e.g. (`~/Sites/apc`) and issue drush commands like `drush cr` or `drush cst`.

Install drushonhost addon: 

```sh
ddev get rfay/ddev-drushonhost
```

See [ddev-drushonhost repo](https://github.com/rfay/ddev-drushonhost) for documentation

You will need: 
`export IS_DDEV_PROJECT=true`

OR

In your project\'s `settings.php` make sure the last part of the file looks like this (the order is critical):

```php
if (file_exists($app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php')) {
  include $app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php';
}

// Automatically generated include for settings managed by ddev.
$ddev_settings = dirname(__FILE__) . '/settings.ddev.php';
if (getenv('IS_DDEV_PROJECT') == 'true' && is_readable($ddev_settings)) {
  require $ddev_settings;
}
```

 Then add this to your `settings.local.php`:
`putenv("IS_DDEV_PROJECT=true");`

Discussion: <https://github.com/ddev/ddev/pull/5328>

Restart the project with `ddev restart`.

Et voila!  You can now issue command such as `drush cr` as if you had first `drush ssh'ed` into the container.  


**Troubleshooting**
If you try to issue `drush dr` while in the project directory and it fails this is the error message to expect.

```sh
$ drush cr

In Database.php line 378:

The specified database connection is not defined: default
```

Try a `ddev restart`



## Drush aliases

These allow Drush to reach out to your client websites from your local machine. The alias files should be stored in /drush/sites (that is above your docroot so they will never be publicly accessible) and can be checked into your repo. If you have a file named `/drush/sites/abc.site.yml` you will be able to issue drush commands like `drush @abc.dev status` or `drush @abc.prod sql-dump \>dbprod.sql` from within the directory for your abc site.

You can clear cache (cr), enable a module (en devel), dump a database to your local (sql-dump), sync files from remote to local:

```
drush @mysite cr
drush @mysite en devel
drush @mysite sql-dump >dbprod.sql
drush rsync <source> <dest> (To rsync files to/from sites.  More on that below)
```

These commands will only work on your computer if you have drush installed globally with all its requirements met. As usual, DDEV has a
nice workaround. To use drush aliases with DDEV, you will need to setup your ssh keys to run in the containers (ddev auth ssh) and then you can issue drush alias commands from within the containers. For example:


```
$ ddev auth ssh
$ drush @abc.test status

Drupal version   : 9.4.8
Site URI         : http://abcmaterialsstg.prod.acquia-sites.com
DB driver        : mysql
DB hostname      : db-1zzzzzzzzb.cdb.database.services.acquia.io
DB port          : 3306
DB username      : uMzzzzzzs
DB name          : 1f3zzzzzzddb
Database         : Connected
Drupal bootstrap : Successful
Default theme    : abc
Admin theme      : seven
PHP binary       : /usr/local/php8.1/bin/php
PHP config       : /usr/local/php8.1/etc/cli/php.ini
PHP OS           : Linux
PHP version      : 8.1.10
Drush script     : /var/www/html/vendor/drush/drush/drush
Drush version    : 11.3.2
Etc.
```

### Example Drush alias file

Here is an example drush alias (`abc.site.yml`) where `abc.dev` refers to a site at the fictitious IP address of 123.45.67.123 and the `abc.devsp` refers to a site at 100.1.2.3. The first assumes there is an ssh key setup on the host whereas the second would expect a password to be entered each time a drush command is issued.

```yaml
dev:
  host: 123.45.67.123
  user: master_gzzzzzz
  root: '/home/zzzz.cloudy.com/kzzzzzz/public_html/web'
  uri: 'https://doug.merrysite.com'
  ssh:
    tty: 0
  paths:
    drush-script: '/home/zzzz.cloudy.com/kzzzzzz/public_html/vendor/drush/drush/drush'

devsp:
  host: 100.1.2.3
  user: spolit
  root: '/var/www/dev.paris.com/web'
  uri: 'https://dev.paris.com'
  ssh:
    tty: 0
    options: '-o PasswordAuthentication=yes'
  paths:
    drush-script: '/var/www/dev.paris.com/vendor/drush/drush/drush'
```


### Example Acquia Drush alias files

Usually you will need to make your own drush alias files. Here is an example alias file from Acquia. If this file is named `/drush/sites/abc.site.yml` you will be able to issue drush commands like `drush @abc.dev status` or `drush @abc.prod sql-dump >dbprod.sql` from within the directory for your abc site. The command `drush @abc.dev status` will return the status for the dev site. The command `drush @abc.prod
sql-dump >dbprod.sql` will download the entire production from the production server database into a local file called `dbprod.sql`. For DDEV
use, you should gzip the file and then you can easily import it into your local DDEV database with a command like `ddev import-db
--src=dbprod.sql.gz`.

Note. The section in the file below with ssh and tty in it is to resolve a problem (from <https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/4004> ) with the sql-dump drush command. Check the afforementioned Github.com issue link for side-effects.

Also, a little unusual is the `prod.livdev` section below. This facilitates using Acquia\'s live dev environment feature but is not
necessary for hosting environments other than Acquia. 

For more on using Drush aliases with Acquia see <https://docs.acquia.com/cloud-platform/manage/ssh/drush/aliases/>

```yaml
# Application 'abcmaterials', environment 'dev'.

### Example Drush alias file from Drush project

You can view this on github at <https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/master/examples/example.site.yml>

```yaml
#
# Example of valid statements for an alias file.

# Basic Alias File Usage
#
# In its most basic form, the Drush site alias feature provides a way
# for teams to share short names that refer to the live and staging sites
# (usually remote) for a given Drupal site.
#
# 1. Make a local working clone of your Drupal site and then
#    `cd` to the project work to select it.
# 2. Add an alias file called $PROJECT/drush/sites/self.site.yml,
#    where $PROJECT is the project root (location of composer.json file).
# 3. Run remote commands against the shared live or stage sites
#
# Following these steps, a cache:rebuild on the live environment would be:
#
#   $ drush @live cache:rebuild
#
# The site alias file should be named `self.site.yml` because this name is
# special, and is used to define the different environments (usually remote)
# of the current Drupal site.
#
# The contents of the alias file should look something like the example below:
#
# @code
# # File: self.site.yml
# live:
#   host: server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/live/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
# stage:
#   host: server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/stage/drupal
#   uri: http://stage.example.com
# @endcode
#
# The top-level element names (`live` and `stage` in the example above) are
# used to identify the different environments available for this site. These
# may be used on the command line to select a different target environment
# to operate on by prepending an `@` character, e.g. `@live` or `@stage`.
#
# All of the available aliases for a site's environments may be listed via:
#
#   $ drush site:alias @self
#
# The elements of a site alias environment are:
#
# - 'host': The fully-qualified domain name of the remote system
#   hosting the Drupal instance. **Important Note: The remote-host option
#   must be omitted for local sites, as this option controls various
#   operations, such as whether or not rsync parameters are for local or
#   remote machines, and so on.
# - 'user': The username to log in as when using ssh or rsync. If each user
#    has to use own username, you can create an environment variable which holds
#    the value, and reference via ${env.PROJECT_SSH_USER} (for example). Or you may
#    omit the `user:` item and specify a user in the `~/.ssh/config` file.
# - 'root': The Drupal root; must not be specified as a relative path.
# - 'uri': The value of --uri should always be the same as
#   when the site is being accessed from a web browser (e.g. http://example.com)
#
# Drush uses ssh to run commands on remote systems; all team members should
# install ssh keys on the target servers (e.g. via ssh-add).

# Advanced Site Alias File Usage
#
# It is also possible to create site alias files that reference other
# sites on the same local system. Site alias files for other local sites
# are usually stored in the directory `~/.drush/sites`; however, Drush does
# not search this location for alias files by default. To use this location,
# you must add the path in your Drush configuration file. For example,
# to re-add both of the default user alias path from Drush 8, put the following
# in your ~/.drush/drush.yml configuration file:
#
# @code
# drush:
#   paths:
#     alias-path:
#       - '${env.HOME}/.drush/sites'
#       - /etc/drush/sites
# @endcode
#
# The command `drush core:init` will automatically configure your
# ~/.drush/drush.yml configuration file to add `~/.drush/sites` and
# `/etc/drush/sites` as locations where alias files may be placed.
#
# A canonical alias named "example" that points to a local
# Drupal site named "http://example.com" looks like this:
#
# @code
# File: example.site.yml
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
# @endcode
#
# Note that the first part of the filename (in this case "example")
# defines the name of the site alias, and the top-level key ("dev")
# defines the name of the environment.
#
# With these definitions in place, it is possible to run commands targeting
# the dev environment of the target site via:
#
#   $ drush @example.dev status
#
# This command is equivalent to the longer form:
#
#   $ drush --root=/path/to/drupal --uri=http://example.com status
#
# See "Additional Site Alias Options" below for more information.

# Converting Legacy Alias Files
#
# To convert legacy alias (*.aliases.drushrc.php) to yml, run the
# site:alias-convert command.

# Altering aliases:
#
# See examples/Commands/SiteAliasAlterCommands.php for an example.

# Environment variables:
#
# Site aliases may reference environment variables, just like any Drush config
# file. For example, ${env.PROJECT_SSH_USER} will be replaced by the value
# of the PROJECT_SSH_USER environment value.
#
# SSH site aliases may set environment variables via the 'env-vars' key.
# See below.

# Additional Site Alias Options
#
# Aliases are commonly used to define short names for
# local or remote Drupal installations; however, an alias
# is really nothing more than a collection of options.
#
# - 'docker': When specified, Drush executes via docker-compose exec rather than ssh
#    - 'service': the name of the container to run on.
#    - 'exec':
#      - 'options': Options for the exec subcommand.
# - 'os': The operating system of the remote server.  Valid values
#   are 'Windows' and 'Linux'. Be sure to set this value for all remote
#   aliases because the default value is PHP_OS if 'remote-host'
#   is not set, and 'Linux' (or $options['remote-os']) if it is. Therefore,
#   if you set a 'remote-host' value, and your remote OS is Windows, if you
#   do not set the 'OS' value, it will default to 'Linux' and could cause
#   unintended consequences, particularly when running 'drush sql-sync'.
# - 'ssh': Contains settings used to control how ssh commands are generated
#   when running remote commands.
#   - 'options': Contains additional commandline options for the ssh command
#   itself, e.g. "-p 100"
#   - 'tty': Usually, Drush will decide whether or not to create a tty (via
#   the ssh '--t' option) based on whether the local Drush command is running
#   interactively or not. To force Drush to always or never create a tty,
#   set the 'ssh.tty' option to 'true' or 'false', respectively.
# - 'paths': An array of aliases for common rsync targets.
#   Relative aliases are always taken from the Drupal root.
#   - 'files': Path to 'files' directory.  This will be looked up if not
#     specified.
#   - 'drush-script': Path to the remote Drush command.
# - 'command': These options will only be set if the alias
#   is used with the specified command.  In the example below, the option
#   `--no-dump` will be selected whenever the @stage alias
#   is used in any of the following ways:
#     - `drush @stage sql-sync @self @live`
#     - `drush sql-sync @stage @live`
#     - `drush sql-sync @live @stage`
#   NOTE: Setting boolean options broke with Symfony 3. This will be fixed
#     in a future release. See: https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2956
# - 'env-vars': An array of key / value pairs that will be set as environment
#   variables.
#
# Complex example:
#
# @code
# # File: remote.site.yml
# live:
#   host: server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
#   ssh:
#     options: '-p 100'
#   paths:
#     drush-script: '/path/to/drush'
#   env-vars:
#     PATH: /bin:/usr/bin:/home/www-admin/.composer/vendor/bin
#     DRUPAL_ENV: live
#   command:
#     site:
#       install:
#         options:
#           admin-password: 'secret-secret'
# @endcode

# Site Alias Files for Service Providers
#
# There are a number of service providers that manage Drupal sites as a
# service. Drush allows service providers to create collections of site alias
# files to reference all of the sites available to a single user. In order
# to do this, a new location must be defined in your Drush configuration
# file:
#
# @code
# drush:
#   paths:
#     alias-path:
#       - '${env.HOME}/.drush/sites/provider-name'
# @endcode
#
# Site aliases stored in this directory may then be referenced by its
# full alias name, including its location, e.g.:
#
#   $ drush @provider-name.example.dev
#
# Such alias files may still be referenced by their shorter name, e.g.
# `@example.dev`. Note that it is necessary to individually list every
# location where site alias files may be stored; Drush never does recursive
# (deep) directory searches for alias files.
#
# The `site:alias` command may also be used to list all of the sites and
# environments in a given location, e.g.:
#
#   $ drush site:alias @provider-name
#
# Add the option `--format=list` to show only the names of each site and
# environment without also showing the values in each alias record.

# Wildcard Aliases for Service Providers
#
# Some service providers that manage Drupal sites allow customers to create
# multiple "environments" for a site. It is common for these providers to
# also have a feature to automatically create Drush aliases for all of a
# user's sites. Rather than write one record for every environment in that
# site, it is also possible to write a single "wildcard" alias that represents
# all possible environments. This is possible if the contents of each
# environment alias are identical save for the name of the environment in
# one or more values. The variable `${env-name}` will be substituted with the
# environment name wherever it appears.
#
# Example wildcard record:
#
# @code
# # File: remote-example.site.yml
# '*':
#   host: ${env-name}.server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /path/to/${env-name}
#   uri: http://${env-name}.remote-example.com
# @endcode
#
# With a wildcard record, any environment name may be used, and will always
# match. This is not desirable in instances where the specified environment
# does not exist (e.g. if the user made a typo). An alias alter hook in a
# policy file may be used to catch these mistakes and report an error.
# @see SiteAliasAlterCommands for an example on how to do this.

# Developer Information
#
# See https://github.com/consolidation/site-alias for more developer
# information about Site Aliases.
#
# An example appears below. Edit to suit and remove the @code / @endcode and
# leading hashes to enable.
#
# @code
# # File: mysite.site.yml
# local:
# This environment is an example of the DockerCompose transport.
#   docker:
#     service: drupal
#     exec:
#       options: --user USER
# stage:
#   uri: http://stage.example.com
#   root: /path/to/remote/drupal/root
#   host: mystagingserver.myisp.com
#   user: publisher
#   os: Linux
#   paths:
#    - files: sites/mydrupalsite.com/files
#    - custom: /my/custom/path
#   command:
#     sql:
#       sync:
#         options:
#           no-dump: true
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/docroot
#   uri: https://dev.example.com
# @endcode

# Example of rsync with exclude-paths
#
# Note that most options typically passed to rsync via `drush rsync` are
# "passthrough options", which is to say they appear after the `--` separator
# on the command line. Passthrough options are actually arguments, and
# it is not possible to set default arguments in an alias record. The
# `drush rsync` command does support two options, `--mode` and `--exclude-paths`,
# which are interpreted directly by Drush. Default values for these options
# may be specified in an alias record, as shown below.
#
# @code
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/docroot
#   uri: https://dev.example.com
#   command:
#     core:
#       rsync:
#         options:
#           mode: rlptz
#           exclude-paths: 'css:imagecache:ctools:js:tmp:php:styles'
# @endcode
```




## Drush rsync

You can use aliases to rsync files using drush rsync.  The syntax is: `drush rsync <source> <dest>`
or more specifically: `drush rsync @sitename.prod:/path/to/files /path/to/local/destination`

You can use `@self` to represent the local site e.g. `drush rsync @labs.prod:%files @self:%files`



To copy everything in `./keys` folder to the `keys` folder on the host use:

```bash
$ drush rsync ./keys/ @sf:/home/master/applications/dir/public_html/keys/
```

Copy 1 file to the dir test server:
```
drush rsync dbprod.sql.gz @dir.testsp:/var/www/dir.tater.com/web/
```

You can also use `:%files` as a source or dest. Examples below:

```
drush rsync @fightclub.prod:/var/www/html/fightclub.prod/docroot/sites/default/files/ ~/Sites/fightclub/docroot/sites/default/files/

drush rsync @dak.prodsp:%files /Users/selwyn/Sites/dakbackup/web/sites/default/files/

drush rsync @dak.prodsp:/var/www/dak.tater.com/web/ /Users/selwyn/Sites/dakbackup/web/
```

Copy 1 file from local to @dak.dev:
drush rsync dbprod-good.sql.gz @dak.dev:/home/1234567.cloudwaysapps.com/hzzzz/public_html/drush-backups/




## Drush SQL-sync

To sync databases use: `drush sql-sync <source> <destination>`

e.g.

```
$ drush sql-sync @flexy.stage @flex.dev
```


### SQL Queries
Examples of SQL queries.  Note. you can update, delete or select.

```
$ drush sqlq "select nid, vid, type from node where type = 'vote'"
35	40	vote
36	41	vote
```

```
$ drush sqlq "select count(*) as redirects"
1
```




## Drupal 7 Drush scripts

Here are some old Drupal 7 Drush scripts in case they are of any interest

```php
//content created my admin - d7
$uid = 1;
$result = db_query('SELECT n.nid, n.title, n.created
FROM {node} n WHERE n.uid = :uid', array(':uid' => $uid));
// Result is returned as a iterable object that returns a stdClass object on each iteration
foreach ($result as $record) {
  // Perform operations on $record->title, etc. here.
  // in this example the available data would be mapped to object properties:
  // $record->nid, $record->title, $record->created
  print_r($record);
}
```

```php
// Login as admin
$admin_uid = 1;
$form_state = array('uid' => $admin_uid);
user_login_submit(array(), $form_state);
// Now the logged in user global $user object become available.
global $user;
print_r($user);
```

```php
// Args
drush_print("Hello world!");
drush_print();
drush_print("The arguments to this command were:");
//
// If called with --everything, use drush_get_arguments
// to print the commandline arguments.  Note that this
// call will include 'php-script' (the drush command)
// and the path to this script.
//
if (drush_get_option('everything')) {
  drush_print("  " . implode("\n  ", drush_get_arguments()));
}
//
// If --everything is not included, then use
// drush_shift to pull off the arguments one at
// a time.  drush_shift only returns the user
// commandline arguments, and does not include
// the drush command or the path to this script.
//
else {
  while ($arg = drush_shift()) {
    drush_print('  ' . $arg);
  }
}

drush_print();
```
It is optiona to have  `<?php opening tag` and a `#!` lines:

This script takes a filename as a parameter and checks if the file exists.

```php
<?php
#!/Users/selwyn/.composer/vendor/bin/drush

drush_print("Hello world!");
drush_print();
$arg = drush_shift();
if ($arg) {
  if (file_exists($arg)) {
    drush_print("yep - it's here");
  }
}
```
